Description: Run programs on Linux with selectively restricted permissions
 Furthermore, the fragmentation of the Linux desktop means that packaging work 
 is needlessly repeated. Programs that build and run on Fedora must be 
 repackaged for Ubuntu. 
 This takes time away from creating great free open source software.
 Subuser with Docker attacks both problems simultaneously. 
 Docker provides an isolated and consistent environment for your programs to 
 run in. Subuser gives your desktop programs access to the resources they need 
 in order to function normally.
